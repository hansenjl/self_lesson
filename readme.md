- Identify self in different scopes
- Properly use self in different contexts
- Correctly write and utilize class variables and methods when appropriate.

   - what kind of method it's inside of
   - if it's in a class method --> self is the class object
   - it it's in an instance method --> self is the instance
- When should we use class variables?
   - when we need to keep track of information that pertains to all instances
- When should we use class methods?
  - when we need to access class variables or create a method that instantiates new objects or does something to the class as a whole
- What is the scope of a class variable?
   - everywhere within the class
- What is the scope of a instance variable?
